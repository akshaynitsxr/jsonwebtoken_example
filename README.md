# jsonwebtoken_example
This  is a basic scenerio where a basic login form has been created using jsonwebtokens.
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) make it easy to send read-only signed "claims" between services (both internal and external to your app/site). 
I have also included the basic usage of image-downloader and json-patch. Json-patch is used to edit JSON objects and change them accordign to a certain pattern.
